## Kin structure of a temperate bat maternity colony

Analysis of genotypic data of 84 chiropteran residents of an urban tree-roosting colony.
All individuals were genotyped at 11 microsatelite loci.

All analyses were conducted in python using jupyter notebook. follow the link below to examine the notebook
using NBviewer.

#### Pre-processing details:

All but three markers were in linkage equilibrium as assessed with FSTAT v. 2.9.3.2 (Goudet et al., 2001).

Pairwise and mean relatedness values (R) were estimated using ML-Relate (Kalinowski et al. 2006), which implements a 
corrected maximum-likelihood method for estimating relatedness that allows loci with null alleles 
to be incorporated into the analysis (Wagner et al. 2006).
